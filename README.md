# HD-Simulator
The goal of this project is to create a game that allows the user to go through the day in the life of a Harley mechanic. This command line game will allow the user to talk to other employees, customers, decide on mechanic diagnostics and many other things. I hope to do this right in honor of what was probably the coolest job I will ever have.
